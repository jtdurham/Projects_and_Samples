-- WORK SAMPLES --

Work Sample 1 Jordan Durham.R

This code builds a linear regression model that forecasts temperatures over time as a function of CO2. It also calculates confidence and prediciton intervals that either do or do not consider parameter uncertainty.

Work Sample 2 Jordan Durham.R

This code creates a simulation model for patient movement through a hospital. It involves queue theory and tracking statistics along the steps of the simulation. This code was taken from a larger simulation program, it will not execute on its own.

Work Sample 3 Jordan Durham.R

This code predicts a binary indicator for product purchase using a random forest model. It includes a means of oversampling the data and obtaining Monte Carlo validation sets. It is de-identified from a client project and therefore will not execute.
